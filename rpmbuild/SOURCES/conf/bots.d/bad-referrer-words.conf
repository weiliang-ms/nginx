# This is merely an example and gets auto included as since Version 2.2017.07 introduced on 2017-04-20
# This file must exist on your system or Nginx will fail a reload due to a missing file
# For all intensive purpose you can delete everything inside this file and leave it
# completely blank if you do not want your Nginx Blocker to include scanning for bad words within urls or referrer string
# Only add one entry per line

# -------------------------------
# !!! WARNING WARNING WARNING !!!
# -------------------------------

# ---------------------------------------
# PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL HOW YOU USE THIS
# ---------------------------------------
# Here is an example of how one supposed bad word can cause your whole site to go down.
# An issue was logged where the users own domain name was specialisteparquet.com
# Because this list contained the word "cialis" it was detected within his domain name causing 
# his entire site to go down and not server any assets.
# That one entry would even cause any site containing a word like "specialist" anywhere in any
# of their sites pages to cause them to be blocked and whitelisting your own domain name in the
# whitelist-domains.conf file will not even bypass this, SO BE CAREFUL PLEASE

# Think very carefully before you add any word here

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PLEASE MAKE SURE that you use word regex boundaries to avoid false positive detection !!!
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# BY DEFAULT ALL THE EXAMPLES BELOW ARE COMMENTED OUT AND HENCE NOT ENABLED

# As you can see in the examples below the word "adultgalls" is entered with a preceding (?:\b) and an ending (?:\b)
# this makes it now "(?:\b)adultgalls(?:\b)". It is crucial to use the word boundaries regex formatting. 

# ---------
# EXAMPLES:
# ---------
#	"~*(?:\b)adultgalls(?:\b)"						1;
#	"~*(?:\b)amateurxpass(?:\b)"					1;
#	"~*(?:\b)bigblackbooty(?:\b)"					1;
#	"~*(?:\b)blacktits(?:\b)"						1;
#	"~*(?:\b)cookie\-law\-enforcement(?:\b)"		1;
#	"~*(?:\b)free\-share\-buttons(?:\b)"			1;
#	"~*(?:\b)free\-social\-buttons(?:\b)"			1;
#	"~*(?:\b)fuck\-paid\-share\-buttons(?:\b)"		1;
#	"~*(?:\b)ilovevitaly(?:\b)"					1;
#	"~*(?:\b)law\-enforcement\-bot(?:\b)"			1;
#	"~*(?:\b)law\-enforcement\-check(?:\b)"		1;
#	"~*(?:\b)share\-buttons\-for\-free(?:\b)"		1;
#	"~*(?:\b)webfuck(?:\b)"						1;
#	"~*(?:\b)xxxrus(?:\b)"							1;
#	"~*(?:\b)zeroredirect(?:\b)"					1;
#	"~*(?:\b|)x22(?:\b)" 					        1; (in this string if your own domain name was sex22.com it would be blocked)


# Here is a list of unsanitary words used in referrer strings - used in various injection attacks
# THE RULES BELOW ARE ENABLED BY DEFAULT
# You can disable this default list by switching the values to 0

    "~*(?:\b|)mb_ereg_replace(?:\b|)"		1;

# -----------
# PLEASE NOTE
# -----------

# If you whitelist your own domain in whitelist-domains.conf and your own domain is passed in the referrer string with an attack string it will NOT be blocked.

# --------
# EXAMPLE:
# -------- 
# This string "http://yourwebsite.com/?s=/index/%5Cthink%5Capp/invokefunction&function=call_user_func_array&vars[0]=file_put_contents&vars[1][]=gqopu.php&vars[1][]=<?php mb_ereg_replace('.*',@$_REQUEST[_], '', 'e');?>$"
# contains the above 'mb_ereg_replace" attack string
# If your domain is whitelisted in whitelist-domains.conf this string will NOT be detected
